//! Every rubocop-rails 2.38.0 rule, one file per rule, grouped by department.

//! [`rules_support::rule_set!`] below is the crate's single registration
//! point; the `registry` crate composes it with the other rule crates.
//! [`DEFAULT_YML`] is the gem's own `config/default.yml`, vendored verbatim
//! (see `rubocop-rails/LICENSE.txt`) for the fixture harness, which resolves each
//! ported case against it the way the gem's own test suite does. At run
//! time the installed gem's copy is read instead, like any `plugins:`
//! entry's.
